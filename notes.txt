--magnitude
||A|| = sqrt(SIGMA count1^2)
||B|| = sqrt(SIGMA count2^2)

--count1
count1 = number of times a word appears in file1
count2 = number of times a word appears in file2

EX:
file1 contains [a,b,c,c,c,d]
file2 contains [a,b,b,b,c,d,d]

WORD      count1       count2         count1^2           count2^2
a           1             1               1                   1  
b           1             3               1                   9  
c           3             1               9                   1  
d           1             2               1                   4 





** Levenshtein distance notes
Levenshtein Score = number of operations to change one string to another

Calculate the similarity score: (1-(LevenshteinScore/MaxLength))*100









** Jaccard Index notes

Union = Present in either set, combined, without repetition
Intersection = Present in both sets

Similarity Score = (Intersection of two sets)/(Union of two sets)
